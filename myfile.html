    <h2><u>What is air ?</u></h2>
    <h3><i><mark>Air is the invisible mixture of gases that surrounds the Earth and is essential for life. It makes up the Earth's atmosphere and plays a critical role in sustaining living organisms, regulating climate, and supporting natural processes.</mark></i>
        <br><br><h2><u></u>Air pollution :</h2></h3></u><h3><u></u>Air pollution refers to the presence of harmful substances in the air we breathe. These substances, called pollutants, can come from natural sources like wildfires and volcanic eruptions or from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, industrial processes, agriculture .</h3>

   <h2><u> About Air :</u></h2>
       <h3><mark>Composition of Air:</mark><br>
        Air is made up of several gases in specific proportions : <br>
        <ol type="1

        ">1. Nitrogen (N₂): About 78% – The most abundant gas, mostly inert and stable.</ol>
        <ol type="1">2. Oxygen (O₂): About 21% – Essential for respiration in humans, animals, and plants.</ol>

        <ol type="1">3. Carbon Dioxide (CO₂): About 0.04% – Used by plants for photosynthesis and contributes to Earth's greenhouse effect.</ol>

        <h3><mark>Importance of
             air :</mark>
        <ol type="a"> 1.Supports Life: Provides oxygen for breathing and carbon dioxide for plants. 

        </ol>
        <ol type="1">2. Regulates Temperature: Acts as an insulating layer, maintaining Earth's temperature.</ol>
        <ol type="1">
           3.  Facilitates Weather: Drives processes like rain, wind, and cloud formation.
        </ol>
<ol type="1">4.Protects the Planet: The atmosphere absorbs harmful solar radiation and prevents meteoroids from reaching the Earth's surface. </ol>
         
    </h3><hr>
    <h2><u>About Air Pollution:</u></h2>
<h3><mark>Common Air Pollutions :</mark>
         <ol type="1">1.Particulate Matter (PM): Tiny particles or droplets in the air, like dust, soot, and smoke. PM2.5 (fine particles) and PM10 (larger particles) are particularly harmful. </ol>
         <ol type="1"> 2.Carbon Monoxide (CO): A colorless, odorless gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuels.
        </ol>
        <ol type="1"> 3. Nitrogen Oxides (NOx): Gases produced by vehicles and industrial processes, contributing to smog and acid rain.</ol>
        <mark>Effect of Air Pollutions  :</mark> 
        <ol type="1">1.On health: Respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, asthma, lung cancer, and premature death. </ol>
        <ol type="1">2.On the environment: Damage to plants, animals, soil, and water bodies. It contributes to climate change and depletes the ozone layer. </ol>
        <ol type="1">3.On visibility: Causes haze and reduces visibility, particularly in urban areas. </ol><br><hr>

        <h2><u>To save the environment from air pollution, we can take simple steps:</u></h2>
        <h3><mark><em>
                To save the environment from air pollution, we can take simple steps:
            
            Use public transport, carpool, or walk instead of driving alone.
            Switch to clean energy sources like solar, wind, or hydropower.
            Plant more trees as they absorb harmful gases and release oxygen.
            Reduce burning of garbage, wood, or coal.
            Avoid using plastic and choose eco-friendly alternatives.
            Use energy-efficient appliances and turn off lights when not needed.
            Support industries that follow eco-friendly practices.
            Spread awareness about the importance of clean air.
            Small actions by many people can make a big difference.</em></mark></h3><hr>
